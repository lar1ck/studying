JavaScript Control Flow Exercises
===================================

Follow these exercises to practice each control flow topic. Create your solution files (e.g., ifElseExercise.js, forLoopExercise.js) in this folder.

1. If/Else Exercise:
   - Declare a variable 'score' with a value of 85.
   - Use if...else if...else to print:
     * "Excellent" if score is 90 or above.
     * "Good" if score is between 70 and 89.
     * "Needs Improvement" if score is below 70.
   - Bonus: Use a ternary operator to print "Pass" if score is â‰¥ 60, else "Fail".

2. Switch Statement Exercise:
   - Declare a variable 'grade' with a value among 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F'.
   - Use a switch statement to display a message based on the grade:
     * 'A': "Outstanding!"
     * 'B': "Great job!"
     * 'C': "Good effort."
     * 'D': "Room for improvement."
     * 'F': "Failing. Study harder."
     * Default: "Invalid grade."

3. Loop Exercises:
   - For Loop:
     * Write a for loop that counts down from 10 to 1 and logs each number.
   - While Loop:
     * Write a while loop that calculates and prints the sum of all even numbers from 2 to 20.
   - Do...While Loop:
     * Write a do...while loop that prints a countdown from 5 to 1.
   - For...in Loop:
     * Create an object with several properties and use a for...in loop to log each key and its value.
   - For...of Loop:
     * Create an array of strings and use a for...of loop to log each element.
   - Array.forEach():
     * Create an array of numbers and use forEach to log each number along with its index.

4. Loop Control Exercise:
   - Write a loop that iterates from 1 to 15.
   - If the current number is divisible by 3, skip printing it (use continue).
   - If the current number is greater than 12, exit the loop (use break).
   - Print the number if it passes the above conditions.

Instructions to run your exercises:
-------------------------------------
1. Open your integrated terminal.
2. Navigate to the exercises folder:
   cd path/to/javascript-learning/01-fundamentals/05-control-flow/exercises
3. Execute your exercise file (e.g., node ifElseExercise.js) to see the output.
